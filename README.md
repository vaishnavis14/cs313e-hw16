This program implements polynomial addition and multiplication using linked lists. It features a LinkedList class that facilitates operations on polynomials by storing coefficients and their corresponding exponents, allowing for efficient management of polynomial terms in descending order. The program reads polynomial data from an input file, computes their sum and product, and outputs the results.
